What is it?
-----------

- Included is only the arcade version of the firmware for the Mojo Retroadapter as it is intended to be used with an alternative PCB which is designed for use in Arcade cabinets or Arcade sticks.

- Arcade mode: 
This version is suited for use in an Arcade cabinet. It works on PCs just like the original RetroAdapter, but I replaced Neogeo stick support on the DB15 with an arcade mode that has just 8 firebuttons on the DB15, to give you a total of 10 buttons and 4 directions when you hook up to DB9 and DB15 both.

- Normal mode: 
This is for regular use and functions identical to the original RetroAdapter. However, it is improved for operation under Android OS. Under Android, the original RetroAdapter was not reporting directions up and left for NES and some other controller types. Note: The Android fixes are also incorporated into the Arcade mode version.
